=head1 NAME

  Math::JS - Emulate JavaScript arithemtic in perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Assign numeric values to Math::JS objects, and perform arithmetic
  operations on those values according to the rules that JavaScript
  uses.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use warnings; use strict;
  use Math::JS;

  my $js = Math::JS ->new(2147483648);
  $js >>= 1;
  print $js;
  # Outputs -1073741824 (same as JavaScript)

=head1 FUNCTIONS

  my $ok = is_ok($arg); # used internally.

    This function is not exported but can be accessed as Math::JS::is_ok($arg).
    It returns true if $arg is allowed to be used in an arithmetic
    operation with a Math::JS object.
    Else it returns false.

  No other functions are provided, except for the subs that are responsible
  for overloading the  '+', '-', '*', '/', '**', '++', '--', '>=', '<=',
  '==', '!=', '>', '<', '<=>', '""', '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '**=' and
  perhaps other operations.

=head1 PRINTING OF FLOATING POINT VALUES

  This warrants some specific documentation because it's not trivial to
  get Perl to print out the values in the same form as JavaScript does.
  (That's in addition to the fact that perl's print() function likes to
  present inaccurate values, whereas JavaScript does not.)

  If your perl's $Config{nvsize} == 8 && you have Math::MPFR (version 4.05 or
  later), then the Math::JS overloading of print() will present the same
  value as JavaScript does.

  Else, if your perl's $Config{nvsize} != 8 && you have Math::MPFR (version
  4.17 or later), then the Math::JS overloading of print() will present the
  same value as JavaScript does .... except for subnormal values.
  (TODO: I intend to eventually fix that little shortcoming.)
  For subnormal values, the overloaded print() function might present more
  decimal mantissa digits than JavaScript does - though both forms will
  accurately represent exactly the same double-precision value.

  Else, without Math::MPFR, the overloaded print() uses perl's sprintf()
  function, which might present more decimal mantissa digits than
  JavaScript does - though both forms will accurately represent exactly the
  same double-precision value.
